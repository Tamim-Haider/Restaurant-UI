# Restaurant-UI
This project is a restaurant UI login and signup page built using HTML and CSS. It provides a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface for user authentication, focusing on simplicity and modern design.
The login page allows existing users to access the system, while the signup page enables new users to create an account by providing basic details. CSS is used extensively for styling, layout control, and responsiveness, ensuring the interface looks consistent across different screen sizes.

This project serves as a front-end foundation that can be easily integrated with backend technologies such as databases and authentication systems in the future. It demonstrates core skills in web design, responsive layouts, and UI/UX principles using standard web technologies.
